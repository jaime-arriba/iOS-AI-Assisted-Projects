> **Bridging Systems Administration and Software Development through AI**

Welcome to my iOS native development portfolio. As an **ASIR (Network and Systems Administration) student**, my core expertise lies in Linux, HPC, and infrastructure. However, I built this repository to demonstrate a critical soft skill for modern tech environments: **extreme adaptability**. 

By leveraging LLMs and AI Pair Programming methodologies, I successfully learned, architected, and deployed native iOS applications in a completely new language (Swift) in record time.
